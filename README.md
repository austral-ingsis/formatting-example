# Formatting Example 2

This repository is intended to show the difference between 'sintactic' changes and 'semantic' changes.
In the class you should use:
- PR: https://github.com/austral-ingsis/formatting-example/pull/1. Use this to show how semantic changes are very hard to identify when there are unnecessary sintactic changes.
- PR: https://github.com/austral-ingsis/formatting-example/pull/2. This PR has the same semantic changes as #1 but without the sintactic change noise.
