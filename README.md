# Formatting Example

This repository is intended to show the difference between 'sintactic' changes and 'semantic' changes.
In the class you should use:
- PR: https://github.com/austral-ingsis/formatting-example/pull/1. Use this to show how semantic changes are very hard to identify when there are unnecessary sintactic changes.
- PR: https://github.com/austral-ingsis/formatting-example/pull/2. This PR has the same semantic changes as #1 but without the sintactic change noise.

## Code conflicts

We also have an example for how a code conflict looks like. You can see it in the PR:

- PR: https://github.com/austral-ingsis/formatting-example/pull/4
